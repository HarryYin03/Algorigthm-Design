### Brute Force

Brute force search for problem state that matches certain characteristics is to generate all possible

states i.e. all possible combinations of state variables, then test each combination against the specified criteria.

### Main idea of the Worksheet

The main idea of this worksheet is to understand the ***fundamental concepts of recursion*** and how it can be used to ***solve problems involving combinations*** and ***optimization***. The worksheet explores generating **all possible combinations of binary digits**, **counting specific combinations**, and **applying recursive techniques** to more complex problems.

### Generating Combinations Using Recursion / Counting Combinations

- generating all possible combinations of elements
- explore all potential configurations, states, or subsets of a given set of items,
- for n-bit binary number, there are 2^n possible combinations because each digit can be either 0 or 1.

### Recursive Concept to Generate Binary Combinations

- Core idea is to use recursions to generate all possible combinations of a given number of binary digits
    - Assigns 0 or 1 to the **current position**
    - **Recursively fills the rest of the positions.**
    - Prints the combinations when all the positions are filled
    
    ### Recursive Combinations Concept Code
    
    ```python
    # i is the CURRENT POSITION in the combination.
    # n is the TOTAL number of POSITIONS(length of the combination).
    # x is the LIST representing the combination. (store all combination)
    def comb(i, n, x):
        if i == n: #  all positions have been assigned
            print(x)
            return
        
        #For each position
        #assign 0 and 1, 
        x[i] = 0
        # recursively call the function the next position "i+1"
        comb(i + 1, n, x)
        
        x[i] = 1
        comb(i + 1, n, x)
    
    # Initialize
    n = 3  # Example for n=3
    x = [0] * n  # A list to store the combination
    comb(0, n, x)
    
    ```
    
    ### ELI10
    
    - a row of 3 empty boxes. (n)
    - Want to fill each box with either a red or blue ball (0 , 1 )
    - So you have 2 choices for each box(red or blue)
    - To find out all different ways you can fil the boxes,
        - start with the first box and decide on a color
        - move on the next box and decide on a color
        - so on
            - you keep track of you choices
            - when all boxes are filled, you write down the combination
                - then you go back and try different choices until you have tried every possible way to fill the boxes.
    

### Code Implementation (Worksheet)

```python
import time
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
N = int(input())

# A list x of length N is initialized to store the combinations.
x = [None for _ in range(N)] 

def Combination(i): # i is current position
    global x, N
    if i == N:
        print(*x)
        return 1 #to count ths valid combination
    else:
        x[i] = 0
        v = Combination(i+1)
        x[i] = 1
        v += Combination(i+1)
        return v

st = time.process_time()
print(Combination(0)) # Becuse starting from index 0 of list x
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et-st}")

### Counting Combinations with Exactly k 1’s

- Goal is to modify combination-generating function so that **“it counts the number of combinations containing exactly k 1’s. and print only the combination with exactly the number of k 1’s.**

### Concept

- Accept an additional input k
- Keeping track of the number of 1’s in the “***current combination”***
- Ensuring that the **total number of combinations matches the binomial coeffcient C(n,k) .**

### Code

```python
import time
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)

N = int(input("Enter the number of items(N): "))
k = int(input("Enter the number of 1's(k): "))
x = [None for _ in range(N))

# "ones_count" keep track of the number of 1's in current combination
# "i" is current position
def Combination(i, ones_count):
		global x , N , k 
		
		#if number of 1's in current combination exceeds limited k, return 0
		# since we don't want more than 'k' 1's. 
		if ones_count > k: 
				return 0
				
		# Complete Combination
		# if 'current combination' equals 'number of items' (recursive stop)
		if i == N:
				
				# if number of 1's in current combination equal 1, return 1.
				if ones_count == k:
					print(*x)
					return 1 #to count ths valid combination
				return 0 #return 0 since this combination doesn't meet the requirement of having exactly k 1's.
		else:
				x[i] = 0 # Assign 0 to current index 'i'
				count_0 = Combination(i+1, ones_count) #recursively call function for the next index ('i+1') without changing 'ones_count'.
				x[i] = 1 # Assign 1 to current index 'i'
				count_1 = Combination(i+1, ones_count + 1)
				return count_0 + count_1 # Return the number of combinations
		
st = time.process_time()
total_combinations = Combinations(0,0) # Initial index and count
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Total combinations with exactly {k} 1's: {total_combinations}")
print(f"Running Time: {et - st}")

### ELI10

### ELI10 (Explain Like I'm 10)

Imagine you have a row of boxes, and you can put either a red or blue ball in each box. You want to find all the ways to arrange the balls such that you have exactly 2 red balls in the row.

1. **Start with an empty row of boxes.**
2. **For each box, decide whether to put a red ball or a blue ball.**
3. **Keep track of how many red balls you've placed.**
4. **If you place more than 2 red balls, stop and don't count that arrangement.**
5. **When you fill all the boxes, check if you have exactly 2 red balls. If yes, write down the arrangement and count it. If no, discard it.**
6. **Repeat the process until you've tried every possible way to arrange the balls.**
7. **Count how many valid arrangements you found.**

This way, you make sure to explore all possible ways to arrange the balls with exactly 2 red balls, count them, and see how long it takes to do so.

### Multiple Combinations

### Algorithmic Explanation

1. Recursive Approach
    - The function `Combination` is called with the initial index 0.
    - For each call, it iterates over the three options ("A", "B", "C") and assigns each option to the current index `x[i]`.
    - The function then recursively calls itself with the next index (`i + 1`).
    - This continues until `i` equals N, at which point the complete combination is printed and counted.
2. Backtracking
    - Backtracking is used to explore all possible combinations by trying each option at each position and then reverting to try the next option.
    - Once a complete combination is found and counted, the function backtracks to the previous index and tries the next option.
3. Combinatorial Generation
    - y recursively trying all options for each position, the function generates all possible combinations of length N with three choices for each position.
        
        NN
        
    - The total number of combinations generated is 3N.
        
        3N3^N
        

### Code

```python
import time
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)

N = int(input())
x = [None for _ in range(N)]
option = ["A","B","C"]

def Combination(i):
		global x, N, option
		if i == N:
				print(*x)
				return 1 #to count ths valid combination
		else:
			v = 0 #To accumulate/stopre the count of valid combinations
			for o in option:
					# the current index is set to 'o'
					x[i] = o
					# Recursively call the function to the next index
					# result of each call is added to 'v'
					v += Combination(i+1)
			return v
			
st = time.process_time()
print(Combination(0))
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et - st}")

### Balance Split: Recursive Brute Force Approach

- ***Using Binary digit 0 and 1 to split every possible group***

### Concept

- Exhaustive Search (Approach)
    - involves exploring all possible solutions to ensure that the optimal solution is found.
    - brute-force approach
    - for each possible state or combination, the algorithm checks if it meets the problem’s criteria
- Recursion (Technique)
    - A technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem
    - In context of brute-force search , ***recursion technique is used to explore each possible combination(brute-force approach) by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems***
- Backtracking
    - A technique used to build solutions incrementally and backtrack as soon as it determines that the current partial solution cannot possibly lead to a valid solution

### Problem Understanding

- Input:
    - A list of n integers representing the values of the goods
    - Each integer value v(i) is in the range 1 ≤ v(i) ≤ 10000.
    - the number of goods n is such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10.
- Output:
    - A single integer representing the minimal possible difference between the total values of the two groups.
1. **Example:**
    - **Input:** `5 8 13 27 14`
    - **Output:** `3`
    - This means one possible way to split the goods into two groups such that the total difference in their values is 3. For example, the goods could be split into groups `[5, 27]` and `[8, 13, 14]`, with sums `32` and `35` respectively.

### Solving Approach

1. Recursive Function
    1. Define a recursive function to explore all possible partitions of the goods.
    2. For each good , decide whether to include it in the first group or the second group.
2. Base Case
    1. When all goods have been considered, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the two groups and return this difference.
3. **Recursive Case:**
    - Include the current good in the first group and make a recursive call.
    - Include the current good in the second group and make a recursive call.
    - Return the minimum difference obtained from these two recursive calls.

### Example Solving

Consider the input `5 8 13 27 14`:

1. **Goods:** [5,8,13,27,14]
    
    [5,8,13,27,14][5, 8, 13, 27, 14]
    
2. **Possible Splits:**
    - One split: `[5, 8, 14]` and `[13, 27]` with sums `27` and `40` respectively, difference is `|27 - 40| = 13`.
    - Another split: `[5, 13, 14]` and `[8, 27]` with sums `32` and `35` respectively, difference is `|32 - 35| = 3`.

### Code Explanation

```python
import sys

data = list(map(int, input().split()))
N = len(data)

x = [None for _ in range(N)]
min_diff = sys.maxsize

def Combination(i):
    global min_diff, x, N
    if i == N:
        group1_sum = sum(data[j] for j in range(N) if x[j] == 0)
        group2_sum = sum(data[j] for j in range(N) if x[j] == 1)
        diff = abs(group1_sum - group2_sum)
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    else:
        x[i] = 0
        v = Combination(i+1)
        x[i] = 1
        v += Combination(i+1)
        return v

Combination(0)

print(min_diff)
```

### Example Input

Let's take a smaller input for simplicity:

```css
cssCopy code
data = [3, 1, 4]

```

### Initialization

- `N = 3` (length of the data)
- `x = [None, None, None]` (to track group assignments)
- `min_diff = sys.maxsize` (initialized to the largest possible value)

### Recursive Function Execution

### Initial Call

```python
pythonCopy code
Combination(0)

```

This starts the recursive process with the first item.

### Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Assign First Item (3)

```python
pythonCopy code
x[0] = 0
Combination(1)

```

- Assign the first item to group 1 (x = [0, None, None])

### Step 2: Assign Second Item (1) with First Item in Group 1

```python
pythonCopy code
x[1] = 0
Combination(2)

```

- Assign the second item to group 1 (x = [0, 0, None])

### Step 3: Assign Third Item (4) with First Two Items in Group 1

```python
pythonCopy code
x[2] = 0
Combination(3)

```

- Assign the third item to group 1 (x = [0, 0, 0])
- Base Case Reached: All items are assigned
- Calculate Sums: group1_sum = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8, group2_sum = 0
- Calculate Difference: diff = |8 - 0| = 8
- Update min_diff: min_diff = 8 (since 8 < sys.maxsize)

### Backtrack and Assign Third Item (4) to Group 2

```python
pythonCopy code
x[2] = 1
Combination(3)

```

- Assign the third item to group 2 (x = [0, 0, 1])
- Base Case Reached: All items are assigned
- Calculate Sums: group1_sum = 3 + 1 = 4, group2_sum = 4
- Calculate Difference: diff = |4 - 4| = 0
- Update min_diff: min_diff = 0 (since 0 < 8)

### Backtrack to Step 2 and Assign Second Item (1) to Group 2

```python
pythonCopy code
x[1] = 1
Combination(2)

```

- Assign the second item to group 2 (x = [0, 1, None])

### Step 3: Assign Third Item (4) with First Item in Group 1 and Second Item in Group 2

```python
pythonCopy code
x[2] = 0
Combination(3)

```

- Assign the third item to group 1 (x = [0, 1, 0])
- Base Case Reached: All items are assigned
- Calculate Sums: group1_sum = 3 + 4 = 7, group2_sum = 1
- Calculate Difference: diff = |7 - 1| = 6
- min_diff remains 0 (since 6 > 0)

### Backtrack and Assign Third Item (4) to Group 2

```python
pythonCopy code
x[2] = 1
Combination(3)

```

- Assign the third item to group 2 (x = [0, 1, 1])
- Base Case Reached: All items are assigned
- Calculate Sums: group1_sum = 3, group2_sum = 1 + 4 = 5
- Calculate Difference: diff = |3 - 5| = 2
- min_diff remains 0 (since 2 > 0)

### Backtrack to Step 1 and Assign First Item (3) to Group 2

```python
pythonCopy code
x[0] = 1
Combination(1)

```

- Assign the first item to group 2 (x = [1, None, None])

### Step 2: Assign Second Item (1) with First Item in Group 2

```python
pythonCopy code
x[1] = 0
Combination(2)

```

- Assign the second item to group 1 (x = [1, 0, None])

### Step 3: Assign Third Item (4) with First Item in Group 2 and Second Item in Group 1

```python
pythonCopy code
x[2] = 0
Combination(3)

```

- Assign the third item to group 1 (x = [1, 0, 0])
- Base Case Reached: All items are assigned
- Calculate Sums: group1_sum = 1 + 4 = 5, group2_sum = 3
- Calculate Difference: diff = |5 - 3| = 2
- min_diff remains 0 (since 2 > 0)

### Code for Visualization

### Step-by-Step Example

Let's go through a smaller example step by step with input `data = [3, 1, 4]`.

1. **Initialization:**
    - `data = [3, 1, 4]`
    - `N = 3` (len of data)
    - `x = [None, None, None]`
    - `min_diff = sys.maxsize`
2. **Recursive Calls:**
    - Start with `Combination(0)`
        - `x[0] = 0` -> `Combination(1)`
            - `x[1] = 0` -> `Combination(2)`
                - `x[2] = 0` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [0, 0, 0]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8`, `group2_sum = 0`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |8 - 0| = 8`
                    - Update `min_diff`: `min_diff = 8`
                - `x[2] = 1` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [0, 0, 1]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 3 + 1 = 4`, `group2_sum = 4`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |4 - 4| = 0`
                    - Update `min_diff`: `min_diff = 0`
            - `x[1] = 1` -> `Combination(2)`
                - `x[2] = 0` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [0, 1, 0]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 3 + 4 = 7`, `group2_sum = 1`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |7 - 1| = 6`
                    - `min_diff` remains 0
                - `x[2] = 1` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [0, 1, 1]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 3`, `group2_sum = 1 + 4 = 5`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |3 - 5| = 2`
                    - `min_diff` remains 0
        - `x[0] = 1` -> `Combination(1)`
            - `x[1] = 0` -> `Combination(2)`
                - `x[2] = 0` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [1, 0, 0]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 1 + 4 = 5`, `group2_sum = 3`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |5 - 3| = 2`
                    - `min_diff` remains 0
                - `x[2] = 1` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [1, 0, 1]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 1`, `group2_sum = 3 + 4 = 7`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |1 - 7| = 6`
                    - `min_diff` remains 0
            - `x[1] = 1` -> `Combination(2)`
                - `x[2] = 0` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [1, 1, 0]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 4`, `group2_sum = 3 + 1 = 4`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |4 - 4| = 0`
                    - `min_diff` remains 0
                - `x[2] = 1` -> `Combination(3)`
                    - All goods assigned: `x = [1, 1, 1]`
                    - Calculate sums: `group1_sum = 0`, `group2_sum = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8`
                    - Calculate difference: `diff = |0 - 8| = 8`
                    - `min_diff` remains 0

Finally, the minimal possible difference found is `0`.

### Balance Split: Advance Optimization Technique

- the efficiency of solving the balance split problem
- enhancement reduces the time complexity from O(n . 2^n ) to O(2^n).

### Enhancement Description

- ***“The sum of values in group 1”*** can be passed along the recursive call as an additional argument.
- This “eliminates” the need to loop through the values to sum them at the end of the recursion
- By passing the sum as an argument, the algorithm avoids repeatedly summing the values in group 1 during each recursive call, thus saving computational effort.

### Key Concepts

- **Recursive Call with Additional Argument:**
    - Instead of recalculating the sum of values in group 1 at each base case, the sum is incrementally updated and passed along with each recursive call.
- **Time Complexity:**
    - Original complexity O(n⋅2^n): The n factor comes from the need to **sum the values in each group** at each base case, while **2n represents the number of subsets of n items**.
    - Improved complexity O(2^n): By **maintaining and passing the sum as an argument**, we ***remove the need to sum values repeatedly***, thus **eliminating the n facto**r.

### Approach and Algorithm

1. Recursive Function: 
    1. Define a recursive function that tries to split the goods into two groups.
    2. For each good , decide whether to include it in the first group or the second group.
    3. “” ***Track the sum of the first group*** “” and calculate **the sum of the second group**  based on the total sum. 
2. Base Case
    1. When all goods have considered, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of the two groups and update the minimum difference.
3. Recursive case: 
    - Include the current good in the first group and make a recursive call.
    - Include the current good in the second group and make a recursive call.

### Code Implementation

```python
import sys

data = list(map(int, input().split()))
N = len(data)
x = [None for _ in range(N)]
min_diff = sys.maxsize
total_sum = sum(data) # Calculate the total sum of the goods

def Combination(i , group1_sum):
		global min_diff, x, N
		if i == N:
		
		#The sum of the second group is total sum minus the sum of first group
				group2_sum = total_sum - group1_sum
				diff = abs(group1_sum - group2_sum)
				if diff < min_diff:
						min_diff = diff
				return 1
		else:
				x[i] = 0
				v = Combination(i+1, group1_sum + data[i])
				x[i] = 1
				v += Combination(i+1, group1_sum)
				return v
Combination(0)

print(min_diff)
```
