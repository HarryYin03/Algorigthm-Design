### Introduction to Creating and Accessing 2D lists in Python

```python
M, N = map(int, input().split()) #represent the dimensions of the 2D list(matrix)
# M is row, N is column
a = [0] * N # a 1D list number `N` of zeros. 
print(a)

b = [i for i in range(N)] # list comprehension to create a 1D list `b` containing integers from 0 to N-1
print(b)

c = [[0] * N] * M #a 2D list with 'M' rows and 'N' columns, all initialized to zero
print(c)

c[0][0] = 1 #set first element of first row to 2D list c to 1
print(c) #can cause issues because reach row is a reference to the same list

d = [[0] * N for i in range(M)] #a 2D with 'M' rows and 'N' columns, all initialized to zero
                                #ensure that each row is independent list
d[0][0] = 1
print(d)

### Knapsack (with memoization)

### Concept

**The 0-1 Knapsack Problem can be approached using dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to break the problem down into smaller subproblems and store the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.**

### Steps

1. Define the Problem Recursively
    1. Let `maxVal(i,c)` = maximum value that can be obtained by considering items from “”index `i` to the end”” with a remaining capacity `c` in the knapsack.
    2. There are two options for each item:
        1. **Skip the item:** The maximum value is obtained by considering the next item with the same capacity
        2. **Take the item:** If the `item's weight`≤ `remaining capacity` , 
            1. `Maximum Value` is obtained by adding the `item's value` and
            2.  Solving the subproblem with the next item and the remaining capacity reduced by the item’s weight
2. Memoization
    1. Use a 2D list `mm` to store the results of subproblems
    2. Initialize the list with `-1` to indicate that the subproblem has not been solved yet.
    3. If a subproblem’s result is already computed (i.e, `mm[i][C] != -1` ), return the stored value to avoid computation
3. Base Cases:
    1. If there are no more items to consider (`i == N` ) or the remaining is zero (`C == 0` ), the maximum value is zero.
    

### Code

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)

# Reading the number of items (N) and the maximum capacity (M)
N, M = map(int, input().split())

# Reading the weights and values of the items
w = list(map(int, input().split()))
v = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initializing the memoization table
mm = [[-1] * (M + 1) for i in range(N + 1)]

# Defining the recursive function with memoization
def maxVal(i, C):
    if mm[i][C] == -1:  # If the subproblem has not been solved yet
        if i == N or C == 0:  # Base case: no items left or no capacity left
            mm[i][C] = 0
        else:
            # Case 1: Skip the current item
            skip = maxVal(i + 1, C)
            take = 0
            # Case 2: Take the current item (if it fits in the remaining capacity)
            if w[i] <= C:
                take = v[i] + maxVal(i + 1, C - w[i])
            # Store the maximum of the two cases in the memoization table
            mm[i][C] = max(skip, take)
    return mm[i][C]  # Return the result of the subproblem

# Printing the result of the knapsack problem
print(maxVal(0, M))

```

### How the Code Works:

1. **Input Reading:**
    - `N` is the number of items.
    - `M` is the maximum capacity of the knapsack.
    - `w` is a list of weights of the items.
    - `v` is a list of values of the items.
2. **Memoization Table Initialization:**
    - `mm` is a 2D list with dimensions `(N+1) x (M+1)` initialized to `1`.
3. **Recursive Function (`maxVal`):**
    - The function `maxVal(i, C)` returns the maximum value achievable with items from index `i` to `N-1` and remaining capacity `C`.
    - If `mm[i][C]` is `1`, the function computes the value:
        - **Base Case:** If no items are left or the capacity is zero, return 0.
        - **Skip the Item:** Calculate the maximum value if the current item is skipped.
        - **Take the Item:** Calculate the maximum value if the current item is taken (only if it fits).
        - Store the maximum of skipping and taking the item in `mm[i][C]`.
    - Return the value stored in `mm[i][C]`.

### Summary:

The algorithm solves the 0-1 Knapsack Problem using a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. It systematically considers each item and decides whether to include it in the knapsack based on the maximum value it can achieve. This dynamic programming approach ensures that all subproblems are solved efficiently.

### Knapsack (using DP into a non-recursive)

### Concept

### Concept: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up Approach)

The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and value, such that their total weight does not exceed a given capacity.

### Approach

### Approach: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing the solutions in a table (usually a 2D array) to avoid redundant computations.

In this bottom-up approach, we build the solution to the problem iteratively starting from the smallest subproblems and combining their solutions to solve larger subproblems.

### Algorithm

- **Initialization**:
    - Create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value achievable with the first `i` items and capacity `j`.
    - Initialize `dp` with zeros, indicating that with 0 capacity or 0 items, the maximum value is 0.
- **Filling the DP Table**:
    - Iterate over each item index `idx` from the last item to the first item.
    - For each item, iterate over each capacity `cap` from 0 to `C`.
        - **Skip Case**: The value when the current item is not included, which is simply `dp[idx + 1][cap]`.
        - **Take Case**: If the current item's weight `w[idx]` is less than or equal to the current capacity `cap`, compute the value when the item is included, which is `v[idx] + dp[idx + 1][cap - w[idx]]`.
        - Update `dp[idx][cap]` with the maximum value of either skipping or taking the current item.
- **Result**:
    - The answer to the original problem is found in `dp[0][C]`, which represents the maximum value achievable with all `N` items and the full capacity `C`.

### Code

```python
def knapsack_dp(i, C):
    # Initialize the DP table
    dp = [[0] * (C + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]

    # Fill the DP table using a bottom-up approach
    for idx in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
        for cap in range(C + 1):
            skip = dp[idx + 1][cap]  # Value if we skip the current item
            take = 0
            if w[idx] <= cap:  # If we can take the current item
                take = v[idx] + dp[idx + 1][cap - w[idx]]
            dp[idx][cap] = max(skip, take)  # Take the maximum of skipping or taking the item

    return dp[i][C]  # Return the max value for the i-th item with capacity C

# # # Example usage:
# # N, M = 5, 8  # Number of items, Max capacity
# # w = [4, 3, 5, 6, 2]  # Weights
# # v = [9, 8, 10, 9, 3]  # Values
# # Reading the number of items (N) and the maximum capacity (M)
N, M = map(int, input().split())

# Reading the weights and values of the items
w = list(map(int, input().split()))
v = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Measure the start time
st = time.process_time()
print(knapsack_dp(0, M))  # Output: 18
# Measure the end time
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et - st:.10f} seconds")
