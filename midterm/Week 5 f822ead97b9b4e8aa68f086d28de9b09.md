# Week 5

### 0 - 1 Knapsack

### Problem Understanding

- a knapsack (bag) that can carry a maximum weight `W`
- a list of items, each with a specific `weight`  and `value`
- **Objective:** a combination of these items to put in the knapsack such that `total_weight` does not exceed `W` & **`total value`**
- is maximized

### Brute Force Approach

### Approach

1. Generate all possible combinations of items:
    1. Each item can be either be included in the knapsack or excluded.
    2. For n items, there are 2^n possible combinations (subsets)
2. Check each combinations
    1. Calculate the `total weight` and `total value` of the items in **each combination**
    2. If the `total weight` ≤ `W` , consider this combination
    3. Keep track of the combination with the highest total value
3. Choose the best combination
    1. Among all valid combinations (those that don’t exceed the weight limit) , select the one with the maximum value. 

### Code

```python
import time
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)

# Number of items, Maximum weight the knapsack can carry
N, M = map(int, input().split())

# list of weights of the items
w = list(map(int, input().split()))

# list of values of the items
v = list(map(int, input().split()))

#Keep track fo which "items are included in ***current combinations***
x = [0] * N

def comb(i):
		# Base Case: We have considered all items
    if i == N:
		    # sw = total weight, sv = total value
        sw = sv = 0
        
        # Calculate the total weight and total value of current combinations 
        for j in range(N):
            if x[j]:
                sw += w[j]
                sv += v[j]
                
        # If total weight exceeds the maximum weight `M`
        # indicating an invalid combinations
        if sw > M:
            return -1
            
        # return the total value of the current combinations
        else:
            return sv
    else:
    #Recursive case: consider the next item
		    # Not including the i-th item
        x[i] = 0  # Not Choose the current item
        a = comb(i+1)
        
        # Including the i-th item
        x[i] = 1 # Choose the current item
        b = comb(i+1)
        return max(a,b) # Return the maximum value between the two scenarios

st = time.process_time()
print(comb(0))
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et-st}")

```

### Algorithm

1. **Recursive Exploration:**
    - Use a recursive function to explore each combination of items.
    - At each step, decide whether to include or exclude the current item.
2. **Base Case:**
    - When all items have been considered, calculate the total weight and value of the current combination.
    - Check if the total weight is within the capacity. If yes, it's a valid combination; otherwise, it's invalid.
3. **Recursive Case:**
    - For each item, make two recursive calls:
        1. Exclude the current item and move to the next item.
        2. Include the current item and move to the next item.
4. **Track Choices:**
    - Use an array `x` to keep track of which items are included in the current combination.
5. **Evaluate Combinations:**
    - Compare the values obtained from including and excluding each item.
    - Return the maximum value from valid combinations.
6. **Print Decisions:**
    - Print the decision-making process in a tree-like structure to visualize the choices and calculations.

### 

### Worksheet Question

### Answer

**Issue:**
Based on the technique in step 1 above, suppose that items are determined in order from item 0 to n-1, when the algorithm is deciding between selecting item i or not, there is no associated information of how the items 0 to i-1 have been selected! Therefore, the total number of states that decide on selecting item i is the total number of ways to select items 0 to i-1, which is 2i2^i2i.

- **Accordingly, the answers of selecting item i may result in different values, yes or no?**
    - Yes
- **Consequently, can we memoize this brute-force code for speed-up?**
    - Yes

### Brute Force With Two State Variables

### Concept

The idea behind using two state variables in the brute-force approach is to more efficiently explore the decision space of including or excluding items in the knapsack. By explicitly keeping track of:

1. The **current item** being considered (`i`).
2. The **remaining capacity** of the knapsack (`C`).

We can provide additional constraints to our recursive function, which helps in reducing the number of redundant evaluations.

### Approach

1. Recursive Function with Two States Variables
    1. A recursive function `maxVal(i , c)` where `i` is the **index of the current item, and** `c` is **remaining capacity of the knapsack (bag).**
    2. At each step, we decide whether to include the current item in the knapsack or to skip it, based on the remaining capacity.
2. **Base Case:**
    - If all items have been considered (`i == N`), return 0. This means we have reached the end of our items list, and there are no more items to process.
3. **Recursive Case:** 
    1. **Option 1:** Skip the current item (`i` ): Make a recursive call to consider the next item with the same remaining capacity
    2. **Option 2: Include the current item**(`i` ): If the current item’s weight is less than or equal to the remaining capacity, make a recursive call to consider the next item with updated remaining capacity and add the current item’s value to the total. if the item cannot be included , set its contribution to `- 1` .
4. Memoization Potential:
    1. This approach inherently shows where memoization can be applied. By storing results of subproblems `( i , c)` , we can avoid redundant calculations and speed up the algorithm significantly

### Algorithm

- **Initialization:**
    - Read the number of items (`N`), the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack (`M`), and the lists of item weights (`w`) and values (`v`).
- **Define the Recursive Function `maxVal(i, C)`:**
    - **Parameters:**
        - `i`: The current item index.
        - `C`: The remaining capacity of the knapsack.
    - **Base Case:** If `i == N`, return 0 (no more items to consider).
    - **Recursive Case:**
        - **Skip the current item (`i`):** Call `maxVal(i + 1, C)`.
        - **Include the current item (`i`):** If `w[i] <= C`, call `maxVal(i + 1, C - w[i])` and add `v[i]` to the result. If the item cannot be included, set the value to `1`.
        - Return the maximum value obtained from skipping or including the current item.
- **Execution and Timing:**
    - Measure and print the time taken to execute the recursive approach.
    - Print the maximum value that can be obtained without exceeding the weight capacity.

### Code

```python
import time

# Reading input values
N, M = map(int, input().split())  # N is the number of items, M is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack
w = list(map(int, input().split()))  # List of item weights

# Recursive function to find the maximum value
def maxVal(i, C):  # index i, capacity C
    if i == N:  # Base case: All items have been considered
        return 0
    else:
        # Option 1: Skip the current item
        #  which continues to the next item with the same remaining capacity.
        skip = maxVal(i + 1, C)
        
        # Option 2: Take the current item (if it fits in the remaining capacity)
        if w[i] <= C:  # w[i] does not exceed capacity
            take = v[i] + maxVal(i + 1, C - w[i])
            # v[i] is the value of the current item

             # i + 1 is the next item, 
             # C - w[i] is the remaining capacity
        else:
            take = -1
        
        # Return the maximum value obtained from skipping or taking the current item
        return max(skip, take)

# Measure the time to run the recursive approach
st = time.process_time()
print(maxVal(0, M))  # Start with the first item and full capacity
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et - st}")

### ELI5

### Explanation Like I'm 5 (ELI5)

Imagine you have a toy box that can hold a certain amount of weight. You have different toys, each with a weight and a fun value. You want to pack the toy box with toys that give you the most fun without breaking the box.

- **Step 1:** You start by looking at the first toy and decide if you should put it in the box or not.
- **Step 2:** If you don't put the toy in the box, you move to the next toy and make the same decision.
- **Step 3:** If you decide to put the toy in the box, you subtract its weight from the box's remaining capacity and move to the next toy.
- **Step 4:** You repeat this process for all toys.
- **Step 5:** Whenever you reach the end of the toys list, you look back and see which decision gave you the most fun value without breaking the box.
- **Step 6:** You compare the fun values of different decisions and choose the one that gives you the highest fun value.

### Example

### Detailed Example

Let's go through an example with 2 items and a maximum weight capacity of 5:

- Item 1: Weight = 3, Value = 4
- Item 2: Weight = 2, Value = 3

### Steps:

1. **Start with item 1 and capacity 5:**
    - **Option 1: Skip item 1:**
        - Move to item 2 with capacity 5.
            - **Option 1: Skip item 2:**
                - No more items to consider. Total value = 0.
            - **Option 2: Include item 2:**
                - Remaining capacity = 5 - 2 = 3. Total value = 3.
            - Best value by including item 2 = 3.
    - **Option 2: Include item 1:**
        - Remaining capacity = 5 - 3 = 2.
        - Move to item 2 with capacity 2.
            - **Option 1: Skip item 2:**
                - No more items to consider. Total value = 4.
            - **Option 2: Include item 2:**
                - Remaining capacity = 2 - 2 = 0. Total value = 4 + 3 = 7.
            - Best value by including both items = 7.
2. **Compare the values:**
    - Skipping item 1 gave a maximum value of 3.
    - Including item 1 gave a maximum value of 7.
3. **Result:**
    - The best decision is to include both items, resulting in a total value of 7.

### Difference between Brute Force Approach and Brute Force with Two State Variables

The primary difference between the brute-force approach and the brute-force approach with two state variables is how they manage the state and recursion to determine the optimal solution for the 0-1 Knapsack problem. Let's compare the two methods in detail:

### Normal Brute-Force Method

### Concept

- The normal brute-force method generates all possible combinations of items (subsets) and checks each combination to find the one that maximizes the total value without exceeding the weight capacity.

### Approach

1. **Generate Combinations:**
    - Use a recursive function to generate all possible subsets of items.
    - For each item, decide whether to include or exclude it in the current subset.
2. **Evaluate Each Combination:**
    - Calculate the total weight and total value for each subset.
    - If the total weight is within the capacity, consider it a valid combination.
    - Track the maximum value obtained from all valid combinations.

### Algorithm

```python
pythonCopy code
def comb(i):
    if i == N:
        sw = sv = 0
        for j in range(N):
            if x[j]:
                sw += w[j]
                sv += v[j]
        if sw > M:
            return -1
        else:
            return sv
    else:
        x[i] = 0  # Not Choose
        a = comb(i+1)
        x[i] = 1  # Choose
        b = comb(i+1)
        return max(a, b)

```

### Characteristics

- **State Management:** Uses a binary representation (`x` array) to keep track of included/excluded items.
- **Efficiency:** Inefficient due to exponential time complexity (O(2^n)), as it evaluates all 2^n combinations.
- **Visualization:** Does not inherently track the remaining capacity or provide direct insight into the decisions made at each step.

### Brute-Force with Two State Variables

### Concept

- The brute-force method with two state variables explicitly tracks the current item index and the remaining capacity of the knapsack at each step. This allows for a more constrained and focused evaluation of possible item combinations.

### Approach

1. **Recursive Evaluation:**
    - Use a recursive function to explore the decision space for including or excluding each item.
    - Track the remaining capacity of the knapsack explicitly.
2. **Base and Recursive Cases:**
    - **Base Case:** If all items are considered, return 0.
    - **Recursive Case:** For each item, decide to either skip or include it, based on the remaining capacity.
3. **Calculate Results:**
    - Return the maximum value obtained from either skipping or including the current item, considering the remaining capacity.

### Algorithm

```python
pythonCopy code
def maxVal(i, C):
    if i == N:
        return 0
    else:
        skip = maxVal(i + 1, C)
        if w[i] <= C:
            take = v[i] + maxVal(i + 1, C - w[i])
        else:
            take = -1
        return max(skip, take)

```

### Characteristics

- **State Management:** Tracks the current item index and the remaining capacity (`C`).
- **Efficiency:** Still exponential time complexity (O(2^n)), but the approach can be more easily optimized with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Visualization:** Provides a clearer view of the decision-making process and the impact of including/excluding each item on the remaining capacity and total value.

### Key Differences

1. **State Tracking:**
    - **Normal Brute-Force:** Uses a binary array to track included/excluded items without explicitly tracking the remaining capacity.
    - **Two State Variables:** Explicitly tracks the current item index and remaining capacity, providing a clearer and more detailed state representation.
2. **Evaluation Method:**
    - **Normal Brute-Force:** Generates all subsets and evaluates each one.
    - **Two State Variables:** Recursively evaluates each item with consideration of the remaining capacity at each step.
3. **Optimization Potential:**
    - **Normal Brute-Force:** Difficult to optimize due to lack of intermediate state information.
    - **Two State Variables:** Easier to optimize using memoization, as intermediate results can be stored and reused.
4. **Clarity and Visualization:**
    - **Normal Brute-Force:** Less clear visualization of the decision-making process.
    - **Two State Variables:** Clearer visualization with detailed explanations of decisions and their impact on the remaining capacity and total value.

### Conclusion

The main distinction between the normal brute-force method and the brute-force method with two state variables lies in the explicit tracking of the remaining capacity, which provides a more detailed state representation and facilitates easier optimization through memoization. This approach also offers a clearer visualization of the decision-making process and the impact of including or excluding each item.

### Memoization

### Concept

**Memoization** is an optimization technique used to speed up algorithms by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. It effectively trades space for time, using additional memory to save computation time.

### Approach

In this implementation, we use a 2D list (array) `MaximumValue` to store the results of subproblems, where each subproblem is defined by the pair `(i, C)`:

- `i`: The current item index.
- `C`: The remaining capacity of the knapsack.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize Memoization Table:
    1. `MaximumValue` is a 2D list where `MaximumValue[i][C]` will store the maximum value obtainable with the **remaining capacity `c`** and considering **items from index `i` onwards**
2. Base Case:
    1. When all items have been considered (`i == N` ), the maximum value = 0 for any remaining capacity. This is initialized in the table as `MaximumValue[N] = [0 for _ in range(C+1)]` 
3. Recursive Function (`maxVal` )
    1. Check Memoization Table: Before performing any calculations, check if the result for the current state `(i , c)` is already computed and store in `MaximumValue[i][C]` . If so , return the stored result.
    2. **Option 1 (Skip the Current Item):** Recursively call `maxVal(i+1,C)` to find the maximum value if the current item is not included.
    3. **Option 2 (Include the Current Item):** If the current item’s weight `w[i]` is less than or equal to the remaining capacity `c` , recursively call `maxVal(i+1, C - w[i])` and add the current item’s value `v[i]` to it.
    4. Store the maximum value obtained from either skipping or including the current item in `MaximumValue[i][C]` .

### Code

```python
import time

# Read input values
N, C = map(int, input().split())  # N is the number of items, C is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack
w = list(map(int, input().split()))  # List of item weights
v = list(map(int, input().split()))  # List of item values

# Initialize memoization table

# MaximumValue is a 2D list with dimensions (N + 1) x (C + 1).
# MaximumValue[i][C] will store the maximum value obtainable with the remaining capacity C considering items from index i onwards.
MaximumValue = [[None for _ in range(C + 1)] for _ in range(N + 1)]

# Base case: Maximum value is 0 when no items are left to consider
# The base case is initialized with MaximumValue[N] = [0 for _ in range(C + 1)],
# meaning no value can be obtained when there are no items left to consider.
MaximumValue[N] = [0 for _ in range(C + 1)]

# Global counter for recursive calls
count = 0

# Recursive function to find the maximum value
def maxVal(i, C):
    global count
    count += 1

    # Check if the result is already computed
    if MaximumValue[i][C] is not None:
        return MaximumValue[i][C]

    # Option 1: Skip the current item
    notChoose = maxVal(i + 1, C)

    # Option 2: Include the current item (if it fits)
    if w[i] <= C:
        Choose = v[i] + maxVal(i + 1, C - w[i])
    else:
        Choose = -1

    # Store the result in the memoization table
    MaximumValue[i][C] = max(Choose, notChoose)
    return MaximumValue[i][C]

# Measure the time to run the memoized approach
st = time.process_time()
max_value = maxVal(0, C)  # Start with the first item and full capacity
et = time.process_time()

print(f"Maximum Value: {max_value}")
print(f"Total Recursive Calls: {count}")
print(f"Running Time: {et - st}")

```

This implementation of memoization in the 0-1 Knapsack problem optimizes the recursive solution by storing the results of subproblems and reusing them whenever needed. This approach ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, significantly reducing the number of recursive calls and improving the efficiency of the algorithm.
