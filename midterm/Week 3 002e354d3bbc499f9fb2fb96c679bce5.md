### Minimum Coin Change

### Understanding the Problem

1. Design an algorithm that finds the ***minimum number of coins*** required to ***make a given amount of change*** using a set of coin denominations. 

**2. Input and Output:**

- **Input:**
    - Line 1: List of coin denominations.
    - Line 2: Amount of change required.
- **Output:**
    - The minimum number of coins needed to make the change.

**3. Example:**

- **Input:**
    - `1 3 4 5`
    - `7`
- **Output:**
    - `2` (Because 7 can be made using two coins of 3 and 4).

### Code Implementation

```python
import sys
import time

# Increase the recursion limit to handle deep recursion
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)

# Read the coin denominations and amount of change from input
CoinChoice = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = int(input())

# Initialize a global counter to track the number of function calls
count = 0

# Define the recursive function to find the minimum number of coins
def mincoin(v):
    global count
    count += 1  # Increment the counter each time the function is called
    
    if v <= 0:
        return 0  # Base case: if the value is 0 or less, no coins are needed

    minX = sys.maxsize  # Initialize minX to a very large number
    for c in CoinChoice:
        if c <= v:  # Only consider coin denominations that are less than or equal to v
        
        # Keep track of min "number of coins required" using this variable
        # +1 represent the use of one coin "c"
        #  mincoin(v - c) represents the value of coin before you. 
        # Example if you are on mincoin(2), it would be 1 + value of mincoin(1)
            minX = min(minX, 1 + mincoin(v - c))  # Recursively find the minimum number of coins

    return minX  # Return the minimum number of coins found

# Measure the start time
st = time.process_time()

# Call the mincoin function with the input amount and print the result
print(mincoin(k))

# Print the total number of function calls
print(count)

# Measure the end time
et = time.process_time()

# Print the running time of the function call
print(f"Running Time: {et-st}")

### Approach

- The approach used in this code is a recursive method to solve the Minimum Coin Change problem. The main idea is to ***break down the problem into smaller subproblems*** and ***solve each one recursively***.

### Technique

1. Recursion
    1. The code uses recursion to explore all possible ways to make the change.
    2. For a given amount `v` , it tries every coin denomination `c`  that is less than or equal to `v`  and ***recursively finds the minimum number of coins*** required to make the remaining amount. (`v - c`). ←——— `v - c`  = change
2. Base Case:
    1. The base case for the recursion is when the amount `v` is zero or less.
    2. If `v` = 0, it means no more coins are needed, so the function returns `0`.
3. Recursive Case:
    1. For each coin denomination `c` that is less than or equal to the current amount `v` , the function makes a recursive call to find the coins needed for `v - c` change.
    2. The function keeps track of the minimum number of coins required using the variable `minX`, which is initialized to a very large value.
    3. After considering all coin denominations, the function returns the minimum value stored in `minX`.

### Code Step-by-Step details

- **Initial Setup:**
    - The input coin denominations are read into a list `CoinChoice`.
    - The target amount of change is stored in the variable `k`.
    - A global counter `count` is initialized to track the number of recursive calls.
- **Recursive Function `mincoin(v)`:**
    - The function is called with the initial amount `v = k`.
    - For each recursive call:
        - The current amount `v` and the coin denomination `c` being considered are printed for debugging purposes.
        - If `v` is zero or less, the function returns `0`.
        - The function iterates over each coin denomination `c` that is less than or equal to `v`.
        - For each coin denomination, it makes a recursive call with the amount `v - c` and adds `1` to the result (representing the use of one coin `c`).
        - The result of each recursive call is compared to `minX`, and the minimum value is stored in `minX`.
- **Output:**
    - The minimum number of coins required to make the change for `k` is printed.
    - The total number of recursive calls made is printed.
    - The running time of the function is measured and printed.

### Rod Cutting Problem

### Understanding the Problem

- a long rod(a piece of metal or wood) of Length L .
- cut this rod into smaller pieces to sell.
- Each piece of a certain length ahs a specific price.
- Goal: figure out the best way to cut the rod so that you make the most money.
    
    

### Example ELI10

![Untitled](Week%203%20002e354d3bbc499f9fb2fb96c679bce5/Untitled.png)

You want to figure out the best way to cut the candy stick so that you get the most money. For example, if your candy stick is 4 inches long, you could:

- Sell it as one 4-inch piece for $9
- Cut it into four 1-inch pieces and sell each for $1, making $4 in total
- Cut it into two 2-inch pieces and sell each for $5, making $10 in total
- Cut it into one 3-inch piece and one 1-inch piece, making $8 + $1 = $9

You need to find the way that gives you the most money.

### How to Solve

- ***list all possible ways*** to cut the rod into smaller pieces .
- ***Calculate the total revenue*** for each possible way of cutting the rod.
- Find the way that gives you the highest total revenue.

1. Use a technique called ***“RECURSION”*** to try all possible ways of cutting the rod and keeps track of the maximum revenue.

### Concept & Technique

- ***Recursion:***  The problem is solved by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving each one recursively
- ***Base Case:***  The recursion has a base case to stop when the rod length is 0.
- ***Dynamic Programming Potential:***  This problem can be optimized using **dynamic programming** to store the results of already computed lengths and avoid redundant calculations. but the provided code does not implement this optimization.
- ***Greedy Choice Property:***  The recursive function tries all possible cuts and chooses the one that gives the maximum revenue.

### Code Implementation

```python
import sys
import time

sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)

# Read the prices into a list
Price = list(map(int, input().split()))
l = len(Price) # Length of the rod to sell

# Initialize a global counter to """track the number of function calls"""
count = 0

def RodCut(l):
		global count
		count+=1
		
		# Base Case
		if l == 0:
		# If the length is 0, no revenue can be made
				return 0
		
		maxRev = 0 #Initialize the maximum revenue to 0
		for i in range(1, l + 1 ): #  i = cut at length "i" 
		# Recursively find the maximum revenue by considering each possible cut
				maxRev = max(maxRev, Price[i-1] + RodCut(l - i))
		retun maxRev

# Measure the start time
st = time.process_time()

# Call the RodCut function with the length of the rod and print the result
print(RodCut(l))

# Print the total number of function calls
print(count)

# Measure the end time
et = time.process_time()

# Print the running time of the function call
print(f"Running Time: {et - st}")
```

### Code Detail Explanation

- **Base Case:**
    - If length of the rod `l`is 0, the function returns 0 as no revenue can be made from a rod of length 0
- **Recursive Case:**
    - Initialize `maxRev` : The maximum revenue `maxRev`  is initialized to 0.
    - **Loop Through Possible cuts**: The function loops through each possible cut from “”” 1 to `l` ”””.
        - For each cut length `i` , it calculates the revenue by :-
            - Price of the Cut Length `Price[i-1]`  + Revenue obtained from the remaining length `RodCut(l - i)`
            - The maximum revenue is updated then.

### Example Walkthrough
