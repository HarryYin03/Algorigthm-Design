### Brute Force Method

- The **Brute Force Method** is a straightforward approach to solving a problem by exhaustively checking all possible solutions.
- In the context of finding the **maximum contiguous subsequence** sum, the brute force method involves evaluating the sum of every possible contiguous subsequence and selecting the one with the maximum sum.

### StraightForward Solution

- The straightforward approach involves evaluating all possible contiguous subsequences within a given list of integers and finding the one with the maximum sum.

### Concept

- A ***subsequence*** is any sequence derived by selecting some (or none) of the elements from a given sequence without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- A ***contiguous subsequence*** is a subsequence that occupies consecutive positions within the original sequence.

### Sum

```python
def Sum(x, i , j):
  s = 0
  for k in range(i, j + 1):
    s += x[k]
  return s 
```

### Brute Force Method

- checks the sum of every possible contiguous subsequence in the list.
- We use two nested loops:
    - The outer loop selects the **starting index** of the subsequence.
    - The inner loop selects the **ending index** of the subsequence.
- For each pair of start and end indices, compute the sum of the subsequence and track the maximum sum found.

### Time Complexity

- This approach has a time complexity of **O(n^3)** because:
    - Two nested loops iterate over all possible pairs of indices, which gives O(n^2) pairs.
    - For each pair, we calculate the sum of the subsequence, which takes O(n) time in the worst case.
    

### Code

```python
def max_subsequence_sum(nums):
		# Initialize to negative infinity to handle negative numbers in the list
    max_sum = float('-inf') 
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Use two nested loops to go through all possible starting and ending indices of the subsequences.
    # Loop through all possible start indices
    for i in range(n):
        # Loop through all possible end indices
        for j in range(i, n):
		        #For each pair of indices, calculate the sum of the subsequence.
            # Calculate the sum of the subsequence from index i to j using the Sum function
            current_sum = Sum(nums, i, j)
            #Update the maximum sum if the current subsequence sum is larger.
            # Update max_sum if the current_sum is greater
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
sequence = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print("Maximum sum of contiguous subsequence is:", max_subsequence_sum(sequence))

```

### Code Visualization

```python
def sum_subarray(nums, start, end):
    return sum(nums[start:end+1])

def max_subsequence_sum(nums):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    n = len(nums)
    visualization = "Max Subsequence Sum Calculation:\n"
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            current_sum = sum_subarray(nums, i, j)
            visualization += f"{'    ' * (i + j)}└── Subarray ({i} to {j}): {nums[i:j+1]}, Sum: {current_sum}\n"
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                visualization += f"{'    ' * (i + j + 1)}└── New max sum found: {max_sum}\n"
            else:
                visualization += f"{'    ' * (i + j + 1)}└── No change in max sum: {max_sum}\n"
    
    print(visualization)
    return max_sum

# Example usage
sequence = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print("Maximum sum of contiguous subsequence is:", max_subsequence_sum(sequence))

```

### Accumulation Technique

Accumulation:  စုပုံခြင်း

### Concept

- create new list aka “**accumulated”** list
- each element at index “i” represents the sum of all elements from the ***start of original list up to index ‘i’***

### Accumulation Visualization

Orignal = [-2 , -3 , 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]

Accumulated = [-2, -5, -1, -2, -4, -3, 2, -1]

### Sum

- Sum up the accumulated List
- If `left` is 0, the sum from the start of the list to `right` is simply `accList[right]`.
- If `left` is greater than 0, the sum from `left` to `right` is `accList[right] - accList[left-1]`.’
- This works because `accList[right]` contains the sum of elements from the start to `right`, and `accList[left-1]` contains the sum of elements from the start to `left-1`. By subtracting the latter from the former, you get the sum of elements from `left` to `right`.

```python
def Sum(accList,left,right):
		#If left is 0, the sum from the start of the list to right is simply accList[right].
    if left == 0:
        return accList[right]

    return accList[right] - accList[left-1]
```

### Why faster than Straightforward Technique

### ELI5 Big Explanation (Too long)

### Straightforward Technique

Imagine you have a big box of LEGO pieces, and you want to find the biggest connected chunk of LEGO pieces. To do this using the straightforward technique, you would:

1. Pick every possible starting LEGO piece.
2. For each starting piece, try every possible ending piece.
3. For each pair of starting and ending pieces, count all the pieces in between to see how many there are.

This means you're doing a lot of counting over and over again for each chunk, which takes a lot of time. If you have 100,000 LEGO pieces, it’s like counting a lot of pieces multiple times, which can be very slow.

### Accumulation Technique

Now, let’s say you have a magic notebook. This notebook can help you keep track of how many LEGO pieces you've counted so far as you go through the box, piece by piece.

1. As you count each LEGO piece, you write down the total number of pieces you've counted so far in the notebook.
2. If you want to find out how many pieces are in any chunk, you just look up two numbers in the notebook: the total number of pieces up to the start of the chunk and the total up to the end of the chunk. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger one, and you instantly know how many pieces are in that chunk.

This way, you only need to count each piece once and write it down. Whenever you need to find out about a chunk, you just do a quick lookup and some simple subtraction. This makes it much faster!

Sure, let's break it down in a simple way, like you're 10 years old.

This way, you only need to count each piece once and write it down. Whenever you need to find out about a chunk, you just do a quick lookup and some simple subtraction. This makes it much faster!

### Picture It

Imagine you have 5 LEGO pieces lined up:

- 2, -3, 4, -1, -2

Using the **straightforward technique**, to find the biggest chunk:

1. Look at the first piece (-2), then add each following piece one by one, checking each time.
2. Move to the second piece (-3), and do the same thing.
3. Keep repeating for every starting piece.

This means a lot of adding and checking, which can get very slow if you have lots of pieces.

Using the **accumulation technique**, you write down a running total as you go:

- 2, -5 (-2 + -3), -1 (-2 + -3 + 4), -2 (-2 + -3 + 4 + -1), -4 (-2 + -3 + 4 + -1 + -2)

Now, to find the sum of any chunk:

- Just look up the totals in your notebook.
- For example, to find the sum from the second to the fourth piece (-3, 4, -1), you do:
    - Total up to fourth piece: -2
    - Total up to first piece: -2
    - Subtract: -2 - (-2) = 0

So instead of adding the pieces again and again, you quickly look up and subtract two numbers, making it much faster.

### Time Complexity Explanation

- The implementation of accumulation technique still involves two nested loops making it O(n^2).
- The significant improvement compare to straightforward O(n^3) is that **the sum of each subsequence is calculated in constant time O(1)** using the ⇒ “””**accumulated list**””” rather than re-calculating the sum each time

### Time Complexity

- Traverse the list once to create accumulated list : O(n)
- **Outer Loop (index `i`)**: Runs n times.
    
    nn
    
- **Inner Loop (index `j`)**: For each `i`, runs from `i` to `n`, which is approximately n−i times.

For each pair (i , j), the ‘Sum’

function runs in constant timeO(1). Therefore, the time complexity for calculating the sum of subarrays can be approximated by summing the inner loop's operations

### Summary

- **Accumulated List Creation**: O(n)
- **Nested Loops for Subarray Sum Calculation**: O(n^2)
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(n^2)

### Code

```python
import sys
import time
data = list(map(int,input().split()))

def Sum(accList,left,right):
    
    #If left is 0, the sum from the start of the list to right is simply accList[right].
    if left == 0:
        return accList[right]

    return accList[right] - accList[left-1]

def AccumulationTechnique(data):

#Creating Accumulated List
    accList = []
    acc = 0
    for d in data:
        acc += d
        accList.append(acc)

    max = (-1) * sys.maxsize
    for i in range(len(accList)):
        for j in range(i,len(accList)):
            
            SumIJ = Sum(accList, i, j)

            if SumIJ > max:
                max = SumIJ

    return max

st = time.process_time()
print(AccumulationTechnique(data))
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et-st:.6f}")
```

### Kadane’s Algorithm

A method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array. It is an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(n).

### Concept

- Local Maximum (maxLocal)
    - Maximum sum of the subarray that ends at the current position
- Global Maximum (maxGlobal)
    - Maximum sum encountered so far across all subarrays
    
    Imagine you are running through the array and at each step, you decide whether to extend the current subarray by including the current element or start a new subarray with the current element. By always making the optimal choice at each step, you ensure that the `maxGlobal` keeps track of the best possible sum encountered so far.
    

- Decision at Each Step:
    - For each element in the array, decide whether to:
        - Add the “**current element”** to the ⇒ existing subarray(extending it)
        - Start a new subarray with “current element” (if starting fresh provides a higher sum)

### Step-by-Step Process

1. Initialization:
    1. Start with the first element of the array
    2. Initialize `maxLocal` and  `maxGlobal` to first element’s value
2. Iterate Through the Array:
    1. For each element, “starting from second element to the end of the array”:
        1. Update `maxLocal` to be the ***maximum*** of:
            1. The current element alone
            2. The current element added to `maxLocal` (extending the subarray)
        2. Update `maxGlobal` if 
            
            `maxLocal > maxGlobal`
            
3. Result
    1. After processing all elements, `maxGlobal` contains the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray

### Code

```python
import sys
import time
data = list(map(int,input().split()))

def KadaneAlgorithm(data):
    maxGlobal = data[0]
    maxLocal = data[0]

    for i in range(1, len(data)):
        maxLocal = max(data[i], maxLocal + data[i])
        maxGlobal = max(maxGlobal, maxLocal)

    return max(maxGlobal,0)

st = time.process_time()
print(KadaneAlgorithm(data))
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et-st:.6f}")

```

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to understand Kadane's Algorithm better.

Given the array:
data=[−2,−3,4,−1,−2,1,5,−3]

1. **Initialization**:
    - `maxLocal = -2`
    - `maxGlobal = -2`
2. **Iteration**:
    - `i = 1`: `data[1] = -3`
        - `maxLocal = max(-3, -2 + (-3)) = max(-3, -5) = -3`
        - `maxGlobal = max(-2, -3) = -2`
    - `i = 2`: `data[2] = 4`
        - `maxLocal = max(4, -3 + 4) = max(4, 1) = 4`
        - `maxGlobal = max(-2, 4) = 4`
    - `i = 3`: `data[3] = -1`
        - `maxLocal = max(-1, 4 + (-1)) = max(-1, 3) = 3`
        - `maxGlobal = max(4, 3) = 4`
    - `i = 4`: `data[4] = -2`
        - `maxLocal = max(-2, 3 + (-2)) = max(-2, 1) = 1`
        - `maxGlobal = max(4, 1) = 4`
    - `i = 5`: `data[5] = 1`
        - `maxLocal = max(1, 1 + 1) = max(1, 2) = 2`
        - `maxGlobal = max(4, 2) = 4`
    - `i = 6`: `data[6] = 5`
        - `maxLocal = max(5, 2 + 5) = max(5, 7) = 7`
        - `maxGlobal = max(4, 7) = 7`
    - `i = 7`: `data[7] = -3`
        - `maxLocal = max(-3, 7 + (-3)) = max(-3, 4) = 4`
        - `maxGlobal = max(7, 4) = 7`
3. **Result**:
    - The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is `7`.

### Code Visualization

```python
import sys
import time

def KadaneAlgorithm(data):
    visualization = "Kadane's Algorithm Calculation:\n"
    
    maxGlobal = data[0]
    maxLocal = data[0]
    
    visualization += f"Initial maxGlobal = {maxGlobal}, maxLocal = {maxLocal}\n"

    for i in range(1, len(data)):
        previous_maxLocal = maxLocal
        visualization += f"Step {i}:\n"
        visualization += f"    Current element = data[{i}] = {data[i]}\n"
        maxLocal = max(data[i], maxLocal + data[i])
        visualization += f"    maxLocal = max(data[{i}] ({data[i]}), previous_maxLocal + data[{i}] ({previous_maxLocal} + {data[i]})) = {maxLocal}\n"
        maxGlobal = max(maxGlobal, maxLocal)
        visualization += f"    maxGlobal = max(maxGlobal ({maxGlobal}), maxLocal ({maxLocal})) = {maxGlobal}\n"

    print(visualization)
    return max(maxGlobal, 0)

# Example usage
data = [-2,-3,4,-1,-2,1,5,-3]
st = time.process_time()
print("Maximum sum of contiguous subsequence is:", KadaneAlgorithm(data))
et = time.process_time()
print(f"Running Time: {et-st:.6f} seconds")

```

### Why is it Efficient

- **Single Loop**: The algorithm only requires a single pass through the array, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
- **Constant Space**: It uses a constant amount of extra space (only a few variables), resulting in a space complexity of O(1).
- **Optimal**: It finds the maximum sum efficiently without the need for nested loops or additional arrays.

- **Greedy Choice**: At each element, you make the best choice (either start fresh or extend the current subarray) to maximize the sum.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The problem can be broken down into subproblems where the solution to the whole problem depends on the solution to its subproblems.

### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initializing `maxLocal` and `maxGlobal` with the first element of the array takes constant time O(1).
2. **Iteration Through the Array**:
    - The algorithm uses a single loop to iterate through the array starting from the second element to the end.
    - For each element in the array, it performs a few constant-time operations:
        - Calculating `maxLocal` using `max(data[i], maxLocal + data[i])` which takes O(1).
        - Updating `maxGlobal` using `max(maxGlobal, maxLocal)` which also takes O(1).

### Detailed Steps and Complexity

Let's break down the steps of the iteration in detail:

1. **For each element `data[i]` from index `1` to `n-1`**:
    - Compute the maximum sum of the subarray ending at `i`:This operation involves a comparison and addition, both of which are constant-time operations O(1).
        
        ```python
        pythonCopy code
        maxLocal = max(data[i], maxLocal + data[i])
        
        ```
        
    - Update the global maximum sum encountered so far:This operation also involves a comparison and possibly an assignment, both of which are O(1).
        
        ```python
        pythonCopy code
        maxGlobal = max(maxGlobal, maxLocal)
        
        ```
        
2. **Loop runs `n-1` times** (since we start from the second element):
    - Each iteration of the loop involves a constant amount of work O(1).

### Total Time Complexity

- The loop runs n−1 times.
    
    n−1n-1
    
- Each iteration of the loop performs constant-time operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
O(1) (initialization)+(n−1)×O(1) (iteration)=O(n)
