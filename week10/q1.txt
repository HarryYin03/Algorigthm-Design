Question 1: BFS Study and State Listing
Task: List out the states in the queue each time a new state is enqueued, until state I is enqueued.

Answer:

The diagram from the PDF presentation can be used to visually understand the BFS process.
For the N-Queens problem, states will consist of partial solutions where some queens are placed on the board without conflicts.
As new states are generated (each representing an additional queen placement), they are added to the queue if they do not lead to any conflicts.
Example of tracing BFS for a 4-queens puzzle might look like:

Start with an empty state.
Enqueue all states with one queen in any row of the first column.
Continue exploring by adding queens to subsequent columns, checking for conflicts at each step.
